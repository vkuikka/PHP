# PHP
Exercises from Hive PHP piscine.

PHP piscine is a great opportunity at Hive to learn PHP in two weeks. The daily exercises are small challenges of increasing difficulty. Both weekends a bigger challenge is given. The first one is in the directory called rush00. It is an e-commerce website that we made in the first weekend. You can find images here: https://github.com/esalorin/rush00-onlineshop
